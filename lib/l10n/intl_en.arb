  "soilRequirement": "Soil Requirement",
  "soilDescription": "Soybean can be grown in a variety of soil types. However, a well-drained, sandy loam to clayey soil with medium water holding capacity, rich in organic carbon, and leveled fields with near-neutral pH is ideal for harnessing maximum soybean yield. Soil with excessive salts/sodium and poorly drained conditions are not suitable for soybean.",
  "tillage_title": "Tillage",
  "deep_ploughing_text": "Deep ploughing is essential during summer, after harvesting the rabi crop. This facilitates exposing the hibernating insects to extreme heat and predatory birds as well as movement of nutrients and infiltration of soil water.",
  "ploughing_3_4_years_text": "One deep ploughing once in 3-4 years, otherwise one normal ploughing in summer followed by 2 criss-cross harrowings or cultivation for breaking of soil clods will make ideal seed bed for a good crop of soybean cultivation.",
  "maintain_soil_health_text": "To have sustainable soybean yield, it is very important to maintain soil health. Hence, farmers are advised to incorporate organic manure (well decomposed FYM @5-10 t/ha or Poultry Manure @ 2.5t/ha) at the time of land preparation.",
  "organic_manure_rotation_text": "If the quantity of organic manure is limited, they are advised to apply the same on rotation basis in their fields every year. It is also advised to apply Gypsum @ 150-200 kg/ha along with FYM/Poulty manure before the last harrowing in case the nutritional requirement is to be planned without sulphur sources.",
  "pre_monsoon_ploughing_text": "Soon after arrival of monsoon, the land may be prepared by 2 crisscross harrowings followed by planking to level the field. If the farmer is interested to apply PPI herbicide for control of weeds, this is the right time to do so.",
  "ppi_herbicide_text": "But for getting the actual benefit of Pre-plant Incorporation (PPI) herbicide, they should ensure that sufficient moisture is present in the soil. This also requires additional tillage for proper mixing of herbicide in the soil. Hence it should be sprayed immediately before second harrowing.",
  "adverse_climatic_conditions_text": "During past few years, soybean yields have been adversely affected across the country because of adverse climatic conditions (Uncertainties/delayed or unpredictable onset of monsoon/heavy storms and long dry spells).",
  "ridge_furrow_method_text": "Considering these, farmers are advised to use BBF or Ridge and Furrow methods for soybean planting in order to mitigate the climatic adversities.",
  "dry_spell_operation_text": "During long dry spells, the crop sown on flat land should receive a dora/kulpa/hoeing operation to reduce moisture loss from soil during early growth period (upto one month from sowing).",
  "harvestingTitle": "Harvesting and Threshing",
  "harvestingInfo1": "Optimum time of harvesting is very important for soybean as it causes yield loss due to shattering and viability loss due to filed weathering.",
  "harvestingInfo2": "Initiation of change of pod color of soybean is the right indication to go for harvesting. At this time, the moisture percentage of soybean grain is around 14-16%. Hence, the farmers are advised not to wait till the foliage/plant turns yellow. Harvesting can be done when 95% pod change colour from green.",
  "harvestingInfo3": "The harvested soybean crop, after sun drying for 2-3 days is ready for threshing. Because of sowing of subsequent crop if threshing is to be performed later, the harvested soybean should be collected preferably on threshing floor and covered with tarpoline to avoid damage from rain/shattering. To maintain viability of the seed and to avoid loss/mechanical damage, threshing should be done at 350-400 гр.",
  "harvestingInfo4": "The threshed soybean should again be allowed to sun drying for 3-4 days in order to bring down the moisture percentage up to 10% which is essential to avoid fungal infection during storage.",
  "harvestingInfo5": "The storage place should be cool with aeration and insect free. The soybean bags should be kept upright as far as possible. If staging is to be done, it should be only up to 4-5 bags in order to maintain the viability/germinability of soybean seed.",
  "harvestingInfo6": "While moving the seed bags to storage house, it should be carefully placed at the appropriate place/platform. The seed bags should not be in direct contact with floor/wall. The moisture seepage in the walls/floor may be a source of infection of diseases, hence can be avoided for storage.",
  "selectionVarieties": "Selection of Varieties",
  "selectionVarietiesInfo1": "In order to avoid risk of yield reduction due to aberrant climatic situations, farmers are recommended to grow 3-4 soybean varieties with varying maturity periods (Varietal Cafeteria Approach) in their fields.",
  "selectionVarietiesInfo2": "Different varieties possess resistance/tolerance to particular insect-pest and diseases. As they mature at different times, it gives convenience for the farmers during harvesting and threshing too.",
  "selectionVarietiesInfo3": "Genetically, the yield of soybean varieties is inversely proportionate with maturity period. Long-duration soybean varieties are able to give more yields subject to application of irrigation in the event of early cessation of monsoon.",
  "selectionVarietiesInfo4": "Farmers are advised to select 3-4 varieties popular among their zone and ensure the availability of seed of these varieties well in advance. They should also check the germination percentage of seed a fortnight prior to sowing so as to have optimum plant population.",
  "selectionVarietiesInfo5": "Farmers are advised to check the germination percentage and perform other preparatory tasks to ensure optimal results during the sowing season.",
  "seedTreatmentTitle": "Seed Treatment and Inoculation",
  "seedTreatmentInfo1": "Seed treatment is very important operation in soybean considering number of fungal, bacterial and viral diseases which causes considerable reduction in plant population and thereby yield.",
  "seedTreatmentInfo2": "Hence, farmers are advised to treat soybean seed at the time of sowing using 2g Thiram+1g Carbendazim per kg seed. They can also use mixed combination of Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% per kg seed or Trichoderma viride @ 8-10 g/kg seed.",
  "seedTreatmentInfo3": "In areas where Yellow Mosaic Virus is infecting the soybean crop every year, farmers are recommended to carry out seed treatment with Thiamethoxam 30 FS (10 ml/kg of seed).",
  "seedTreatmentInfo4": "Once the seed treatment with fungicides and insecticide is done, farmers are advised to inoculate the treated seed with bioinoculants like Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Phosphate Solubilizing Micro-organism (PSM) each @ 5 g/kg seed immediately before sowing.",
  "seedTreatmentInfo5": "If the soybean is grown in nontraditional/new area, they should increase the quantity to at least 10 g/kg seed.",
  "seedTreatmentInfo6": "Farmers are also advised to follow correct sequence of seed treatment with recommended fungicides followed by insecticide and seed inoculation.",
  "seedTreatmentInfo7": "However, if Trichoderma viride has to be used, all the three bioagents can be used in one go for seed treatment.",
  "seedTreatmentInfo8": "They should procure these inputs (fungicides and culture) from the authentic sources and store in cool place to maintain their viability.",
  "sowingTitle": "Sowing Time, Spacing, and Seed Rate",
  "sowingInfo1": "Since soybean is a rainfed crop grown during the kharif season, it is sown only after the arrival of monsoon. Farmers are advised to sow their crop only after 100 mm rainfall is received to ensure germination of seed and development of the plant till the next spell of rains.",
  "sowingInfo2": "The sowing of soybean seed may be done either using traditional tools like bullock drawn Dufan /Tifan /seed drill or by using tractor-drawn machines like Seed-cum-Fertilizer drill, BBF Seed Drill, FIRB Seed Drill keeping row-to-row spacing of 45 cm and plant-to-plant spacing of 4-5 cm at 3 cm depth.",
  "sowingInfo3": "In case of delayed sowing on account of late onset of monsoon, farmers are advised to narrow the row spacing at 30 cm and increase the seed rate by 25% to optimize plant population and avert the likely yield loss due to slow growth.",
  "sowingInfo4": "The seed rate and germination percentage are inversely proportional to the seed size of soybean varieties. Small-seeded varieties are excellent in germination percentage compared to bold-seeded varieties.",
  "sowingInfo5": "Therefore, the seed rate should be modified accordingly to achieve optimum plant population and yield. The recommended seed rate for soybean varieties having medium seed size (JS 20-29, JS 93-05, JS 2069) is 60-65 kg/ha while for bold seed varieties (JS 95-60, JS 20-34, NRC 7), the seed rate should be increased to 80 kg/ha. The seed rate for small-seeded varieties like NRC 37 and JS 9752 should be reduced to only 50 kg/ha.",
  "sowingInfo6": "If farmers have not used PPI herbicide (PPI) herbicides, they are advised to use the recommended pre-emergence herbicide immediately after sowing and before the emergence of soybean.",
  "manuresAndFertilizers": "Manures and Fertilizers",
  "soybeanManureDescription": "Soybean is considered to be moderately exhaustive crop. Balanced nutrients application ensures better yield performance of soybean. The integration of 5-10 t Farm Yard Manure or 2.5 t poultry manure/ha along with the basal application of N:P205:K20:S generally provides balanced nutrition for harnessing the yield potential of soybean.",
  "fertilizerUseDescription": "In soybean, use of fertilizers is recommended only as basal application. Therefore, farmers are advised not to use any fertilizers particularly urea or DAP as top dressing in standing crop unless being recommended by soybean scientists.",
  "fertilizerAndSeedMixingDescription": "Farmers are also advised not to mix fertilizers along with seed during sowing of soybean. In close contact with fertilizer it gets rotten in the soil. They should ensure the placement of seed at 3 cm and the fertilizer placement at 5 cm in the soil. The top dressing of fertilizer in soybean is generally avoided or to be used in consultation with soybean scientists.",
  "intercroppingTitle": "Intercropping in Soybean",
  "intercroppingDescription1": "Soybean is grown throughout the country as a rainfed crop during June/July-October...",
  "intercroppingDescription2": "Intercropping of soybean with suitable companion crops is found to be remunerative...",
  "intercroppingDescription3": "When intercropped, the sowing can be done at 30 cm row to row spacing...",
  "waterManagement": "Water Management",
  "waterDescription1": "Soybean is, by and large, grown as a rainfed crop during kharif season. Since last few years the distribution of rainfall was found to be uneven and erratic. Long dry spells, particularly during critical growth stages like seedling, flowering, and pod fill affect the yield adversely. Hence, farmers are advised to apply life saving irrigation during these critical stages in order to sustain yield levels. Farmers are advised to use BBF or Ridge and Furrow methods for soybean planting in order to mitigate the climatic adversities. The BBF or FIRB seed drill machines developed by ICAR-ISR can be used for the same.",
  "waterDescription2": "As explained earlier, seedling, flowering and pod formation are the critical growth stages of soybean. Hence, during any of these stages, life saving irrigation should be given to soybean in case of long dry spells.",

  "generalPrecautions": "General Precautions",
  "precaution1": "While using PPI herbicides, proper soil incorporation of herbicide must be ensured and it should be used only on moist soil.",
  "precaution2": "In case of PPI or PE herbicide application, farmers are advised to intercultivate the soybean crop by Dora/ Kulpa in between 20 to 25 DAS.",
  "precaution3": "To control the weeds effectively, it is very necessary to make the appropriate spraying solution and its uniform spray on entire area/weed foliage.",
  "precaution4": "Hence farmers are advised to use 500 litres of water per hectare along with recommended quantity of herbicides using Flat Fan or Flood Jet nozzle.",
  "precaution5": "It is also advised that, farmers should not carry any intercultural operations (Dora/Kulpa) till 10 days after spraying of PPI or PE herbicides. Similarly, same herbicide may not be used every year.",
  "lossesText": "Weeds cause soybean yield losses up to 70% if not controlled. Weed management is very important operation in Vertisols and associated soils because of continuous rains. Weeds compete with soybean for nutrition and other natural resources at very higher rate. Hence, their management is very essential at appropriate stage. Yield losses depend on the time of weed occurrence, types of weeds and duration of weeds present in the field.",
  "weedManagementText1": "The soybean crop should be weed free at least till 45 days after sowing (DAS).",
  "weedManagementText2": "The priority-wise agronomic practices for this include two manual weeding (20 and 40 DAS) or intercultivation (Hand hoe/Dora/Kulpa). If it is not feasible due to continuous rains, then one can opt for chemical weed control.",

  "damageContent": "Newly hatched larvae are gregarious and skeletomize the leaves by feeding on the chlorophyll content. After 8-10 days, larvae scatter to neighboring plants and consume leaves. If timely control measures are not taken, population of larvae and the damage increase very rapidly. On heavy incidence, they completely denude the plants. This results in reduction in grain number and weight per pod and ultimately in yield. Larvae damage the crop from July-August to October.",
  "managementContent": "Generally the Bihar hairy caterpillar can be found in abundant numbers on a single soybean plant and feed on foliage leaving only veins. These plants should be removed and destroyed for preventing its further spread. If needed, the crop should be sprayed with Triazophos 40 EC (0.8 l/ha) or Quinolphos 25 EC (1.5 l/ha) or Indoxacarb 14.5 SC (0.3 l/ha) or Chlorentraniliprol 18.5 SC (0.10 l/ha) to manage the pests.",

Distributed throughout soybean-growing areas of India but more prevalent in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, and the North Eastern States. The disease has the potential to cause 15-53% loss, but in India, maximum yield losses can go up to 37% with an average loss of 20% under favorable conditions. The loss is mainly due to defoliation, production of empty pods, and reduction in number and seed size. Warm (temperature around 28°C) and humid weather with frequent showers favor the disease. Unlike bacterial blight, bacterial pustule is not checked by high temperature.",
  "symptomsContent": "1. On well-grown plants: The disease appears as minute, pale green elevated spots on interveinal areas on both sides of the leaves. Later on, small raised light gray to yellowish pustules are formed in the center of spots, usually on the undersurface, with a pale green halo around them. The pustules may coalesce into large spots. Leaves become ragged when dead areas are torn away by the wind. Spots may also develop on pods of susceptible varieties.",

The disease has a narrow host range and is transmitted in a non-persistent manner by about 32 aphid species belonging to 15 different genera. It affects seedlings, leaves, stems, petioles, pods, and seeds. The disease occurs all over the soybean-growing areas of India. It can reduce yields ranging from 50 to 93%. Losses ranging from 2-30% have been reported from Delhi. Symptoms are more severe with cool temperature (near 18°C) and humid conditions but less severe at 24-25°C, while symptoms are masked above 30°C. The way of expression of the disease depends on the virus strain, host genotype, environmental conditions, and the presence of other complementary viruses.",
  "mosaicSymptoms": "1. On seed and seedling: Infected seeds many times get mottled by having the same color on the seed coat as that of the hilum, which is popularly known as hilum bleeding. When infected seeds are used for sowing, the initial symptoms of the disease are severe mosaic of dark and light green areas and downward curling of primary leaves giving seedlings a spindly appearance. Such plants have rugosed, crinkled, mottled, and curled unifoliate leaves. Subsequently, trifoliate leaves become chlorotic, severely stunted, mottled, and rugosed. Plants get stunted with shortened petioles and internodes.\n\n2. On well-grown plant: Trifoliate leaves have a mosaic of light and dark green areas that may later become raised or blistered mostly along the main veins. Dark green enations along the puckered leaves and necrosis are also occasionally present. Browning may also be visible in stems and petioles.",

This virus has been described as a pleomorphic and unstable myxovirus. It affects leaves, buds (especially terminal buds), stems, petioles, and pods. The disease is widely distributed throughout India. It was severe in Parbhani (Maharashtra) in 1986, in Karnataka in 1986, and in Sehore (Madhya Pradesh) in 1987, where it caused an epidemic situation. Yield losses of 70-80% in Karnataka and 12% in Delhi have been reported. The disease is more severe when the temperature is below 25°C and when there is water stress. The infection is less likely when the temperature is low during the winter. The symptoms are also less pronounced during the cold period.",
  "symptom_details": "1. On fully grown plants: The most prominent symptom is the browning and twisting of the terminal buds, which later develops into a crook shape. Other buds become brown, necrotic, and brittle. Necrosis is also common in the leaves, midrib, petiole, and stems. The petioles often become thick and small and may be curled, distorting the shoot tips. Sometimes, petioles become so brittle that they break when pinched between the fingers. The leaves become smaller, curled, and the leaf surface becomes rough and bronze-like. If the infection occurs early, the plants become severely stunted, with reduced internodal length and many auxiliary shoots. Pods do not form or are severely underdeveloped or destroyed.",
  "management_details": "Resistant varieties and appropriate chemical control are not available. However, the following measures can help in reducing the severity of the disease and minimize yield loss. Less susceptible varieties like JS71-05, JS 79-81, KHSb 1, etc., should be used. Crops should be kept free from broadleaf weeds. Infected plants or plant parts should be rogueed and burned.

It is found to occur commonly in the states of M.P., Uttaranchal, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Rajasthan. Soybean maturing under warm and humid conditions may be severely damaged.",
  "decay_symptoms_text": "1. On seedling: Heavily infected seeds crack badly, shrivel and remain covered with dirty white mycelium. Seedlings emerge from infected seeds have seed coat attached to cotyledons preventing proper opening of the cotyledons. Bright red to brown lesions are also produced on cotyledons which may result in seedling blight.\n2. On well-grown plant: Characteristic symptom is arrangement of black speck sized pycnidia linearly with light brown to whitish background on infected petiole of abscised leaves, broken branches, stems, and pods, later in the season. Under favorable conditions, infection may appear as premature death of etiolated branches, shedding of leaves, and undeveloped pods. Pod blight results in moldy and light seeds. Leaf infection is rare and latent infection is common.",
  "decay_management_text": "Ploughing down crop residues. Using healthy seed and crop rotation technique. Use of moderately resistant varieties viz. Bragg, KHSb 2, Himso 1563, JS 71-05, JS80-21, NRC 37, PK 262, VLS 2 etc. Seed treatment with thiram + carbendazim (2:1) @ 3 g/kg.

  "fusarium_title": "Fusarium Collar and Pod Rot",
  "fusarium_description_text": "Causal Organism: Fusarium equiseti(Corda) Sacc. is the major and commonly occurring causal organism of Fusarium pod and collar rot in India. The pathogen is soil and seed borne. (Fusarium oxysporum producing blight, wilt and root rot, F. graminearum, F. moniliforme and F. solani causing pod and collar rot are also reported from India). Fusarium in combination with other soil and seed borne pathogens causes seed and seedling rots. It affects Collar (Stems), pods and seeds. Disease is commonly occurring in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Delhi etc. It can cause up to 64% loss in yield.",
  "fusarium_symptoms_text": "1. On seed and Seedling: Sometimes seed coat and cotyledons of the seeds may turn dark brown to black. Depressed, water-soaked, cream-colored and serrated lesions on cotyledons and hypocotyl of emerging or emerged seedlings. Later on these lesions turn dark brown to black and coalesce with each other. Hypocotyls become thin and soft and roots remain underdeveloped.\n2. On well-grown plant: Pods dry prematurely from tip to base and become dark brown to black. Severely infected pods produce no seeds.",

The disease is distributed throughout the soybean growing area of India but more prominent in Madhya Pradesh. When it appears early, the disease can cause 20 to 40% loss in yield under favourable conditions. Warm and humid weather favours the disease.",
  "myrothecium_symptoms_text": "1. On seed and seedling: Infected seeds when sown cause seed rot and blight of emerged seedlings.\n2. On well-grown plant: Disease is visible around 30 to 35 days after planting as small round brown spots on leaves. Later on these spots become dark with dark brown or purple margin surrounded by a translucent area in concentric rings. Slowly spots merge with each other and become of irregular shape. On maturity, sporodochia are visible as white erumpent structures on translucent zone of the spots, which later turn to black dot-like structures. This is the characteristic symptom of the disease.",

  "root_title": "Root Rot, Stem Rot & Aerial Blight",
  "root_description_text": "Causal Organism: The disease is incited by Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn., whose teleomorph is Thanatephorus cucumeris. The pathogen is seed, soil and air borne. It affects roots, lower stems (just below soil line in seedlings as well as in mature plants), stems, leaves, petioles and pods. Distributed throughout India but more severe in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttaranchal. It can cause up to 35% loss in yield on account of pre and post-emergence damping off, root rot, seedling blight and blight in well-grown plants resulting in fewer pods and seeds per pod. A temperature range of 24 to 32°C and continued wet soil condition with soil moisture at 30-60 percent of water holding capacity is favorable for root rot phase. Whereas soil moisture of about 70 percent of water holding capacity, sandy and light soils and pH greater than 6.6 favors seedling blight phase. Rain or free moisture on plant surface with warm wet or humid weather is very important for the development of foliar/aerial blight phase of the disease. Severity of disease increases with monoculture of soybean.",
  "root_symptoms_text": "1. Seed and Seedling: Infected seeds have irregularly shaped tan or light brown sunken lesions. Seedlings with infected shoot apices stop growing and become stunted and cotyledons remain green. Reddish-brown sunken lesions on roots and basal portion of the stems just above the soil line, which are often surrounded by brown mycelial growth. Besides causing pre-emergence mortality, seedlings may die later on as the lower part of the taproot and the secondary root system are usually killed.\n2. On well-grown plant: Small or large initially water-soaked and then grayish-brown to reddish-brown spots which later turn to dark brown appear first on lower leaves. Later on, entire leaf gets blighted in due course. Root rot of adult plant in the form of brown to dark brown discoloration of the cortical and lignified tissues is also common, which is most evident during flowering. Development of a reddish-brown canker around the base of the stem, easy peeling off cortical tissues of the root and drooping of leaves which remain attached to the dead plant are the other characteristics of this disease. Subsequently, at times patches of dead or dried plants are visible in the field.",
